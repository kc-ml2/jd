# ML2 is looking for new members!
## About KC Machine Learning Lab (ML2)
* ML2 is an independent research organization within [KC](http://www.kct.co.kr/), a semiconductor and display solutions company.
* ML2 focuses on machine learning research with a long-term vision, looking beyond pushing the envelope of the current state of the art and identifying topics that will open new fields of research and development.
* The roles of ML2 inside KC are
  * in a short term (a few years), we
    * perform academic researches in machine learning and develop associated technologies,
    * collaborate with other companies and universities that are working on machine learning, and
    * help KC and its affiliated companies apply machine learning to manufacturing solutions in semiconductor and display industries.
  * in a mid-term (~5 years or more), we 
    * internalize theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning via such researches and developments, and 
    * attract and secure talents who can understand and utilize such knowledge inside KC, 
  * and in the long run (a decade or more), we
    * obtain and maintain the leadership in specific key elements of machine learning, and
    * support for and invest in entrepreneurial teams as an incubator of machine learning research and development.
* ML2 focuses on doing academic researches to keep close relationships with other research entities and build in-house expertises. 
  * When a business opportunity is derived from research activities of ML2, KC forms a separate team to pursue commercial applications. 
* ML2 runs a machine learning incubation program.
  * A team built for the business opportunity participates in the incubation program and runs an independent operation for the business venture.
  * ML2 members who are interested in the project will be encouraged to join the team full-time. 
  * A person or a team outside ML2 who wants to develop business ideas around machine learning can also join the incubation program.
* ML2 works based on the following principles:
  * We value the independence of each researcher.
  * We actively seek collaborations with other research group.
  * We encourage outreach activities such as contributing open-source softwares, organizing meetups, and presenting talks.
* ML2 strives for diversity in all aspects, including but not limited to gender, race, and ethnicity.
